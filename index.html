            <div class="content">Reading adds a crisp coating or crust to the exterior of the chicken. What separates fried chicken from other fried forms of chicken is that generally the chicken is cut at the joints, and the bones and skin are left intact. Crisp well-seasoned skin, rendered of excess fat, is a hallmark of well made fried chicken. When being cooked, fried chicken is often divided into smaller pieces. The chicken is then generally covered in a batter, often consisting of ingredients such as eggs or milk, and a thickener such as flour.This is used to create a crust on the exterior of the meat. In addition, seasoning is often added at this stage. </div>

            <div class="content">Darby said Indonesia’s situation has to be put into context: The country’s balance of payments position is “actually very good,” he said, adding that its foreign exchange reserves are near record highs. On top of that, the Indonesian economy is also experiencing “quite a decent manufacturing revival.”Still, he admitted that keeping Covid under control is likely to stand in the way of Indonesia reaching its full economic potential. The country is lagging globally in its vaccination efforts – only 5.95% of the Indonesian population was fully vaccinated as of July 18, according to Our World in Data.</div>

            <div class="content">“The reality is that … you’re likely to not reach full economic potential until you get to some form of herd immunity,” Darby said. “Unfortunately, the potential for Indonesia to meet its pre-pandemic levels is probably quite low at the moment given the poor rollout of the vaccine.”The guest had taken a rapid antigen test prior to boarding the cruise that came back negative, but contact tracing revealed the guest was a close contact of a confirmed Covid-19 case. The guest was then immediately isolated and tested positive for the virus on Tuesday, Dream Cruises, owned by Genting Cruise Line, said in a statement.</div>
